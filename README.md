# CSC210_F19
CSC210 Data Structures Fall 2019

This repository will be used to distribute lab assignments and their solutions. If you are inspired, you can learn how to use the full power of Github by downloading git onto your machine and cloning the repository. However, you can limit your use of Git to this web interface. If you want to download the files, click on the Clone or Download button and choose to download. All files will be downloaded every time you click on this button. If you clone the repo, you can _pull_ from the repo and grab only those elements that have changed since the last time you pulled from the repo. There are great resources on Git and GitHub. You can start here at my Git page from when I was at UMN. Some of it only pertains to UMN's enterprise version, but there is a lot there for the public version of Git and GitHub: <a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~lars1050/repo-website-resources/website/examples/csresources/git.html" target="_blank">Larson Git Reference Page</a>.

### Working With Java

All machines in the lab have Java SE and NetBeans installed. If you want to use Java on your personal machine you must first install Java SE. You can install the latest 12.x version, although people often say that you might not want the latest and greates because the bugs have not yet been worked out. The 11.x or 8u221 versions will be fine.

If you want to use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), you will also need to install that -- NetBeans, IntelliJ, and Eclipse are common IDE's. These are called integrated because editing, compiling, and executing are all integrated (and typically they have the bonus of debugging and integration with a code repository like Git).

Or you can go without the IDE and modify in your favorite code editor (e.g. Atom, Xemacs, Vim, Submlime, NotePad++), then use the command line to compile and run the code. On my Mac, compiliation followed by execution looks like this ...
